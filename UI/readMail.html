              <P>An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to
                hold public office.[1] Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative
                democracy has operated since the 17th century.[1] Elections may fill offices in the legislature,
                sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government. This process is also
                used in many other private and business organizations, from clubs to voluntary associations and
                corporations.[2]
                The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative
                democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the
                Elections were not used were
                considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known
                as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.</P>

              Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in
              place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems.
              Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view
              to predicting future results).
              To elect means "to choose or make a decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as
              referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.</P>
